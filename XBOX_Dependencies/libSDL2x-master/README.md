# libSDL2x

This is a port of SDL 2 to the orignal Xbox.

The port is still in pre-beta stages as it has only been tested with a few SDL2 samples (lazyfoo.net) as well as marty28's port of DevilutionX

### SDL2 Todo:
- Separate alpha blend.
- YUV texture support (mostly used for video playback?).
- Need to get TextInput working.
- No onscreen keyboard.
- Missing SDL hidapi subsystem (is this likely to be used for ports to Xbox tho?).

### Working SDL2 Addons
- SDL2 Mixer

### Notes:

Special thanks to marty28 for its port of SDL2 as well as Lantus/MVG and Hyper_Eye, their work on the SDL 1.2 port.
